# Pros and Cons of TDD
The pros of TDD include early bug detection, improved code quality, and the establishment of benchmarks. Using TDD makes it easier for developers to create well-structured and clean code, while also allowing them to identify and fix bugs in the early stages of the development process. This, in turn, reduces the time and cost required for addressing these issues later in the development cycle. Furthermore, these tests serve as benchmarks for the product, ensuring that the application passes all of them and behaves as expected.
Alternatively, the cons of TDD involve the time-consuming nature of the process and the need for ongoing maintenance. Since developers are required to write tests before writing code, it can be a time-intensive process that might otherwise be spent on actual coding. This can be a concern, especially when working on projects with tight deadlines. Additionally, TDD requires regular maintenance. As the codebase evolves and the software undergoes changes, some of the existing tests may become outdated. It is essential to keep track of these tests and update them as the project progresses, which also demands extra effort and time.
